# PS-DUMP
Poweshell scripts dump.

rec-twitch:

This script is just a modification to a job script I needed to make to capture an internet video stream at a specific time until $X. Anyway it expects streamlink is in the Windows PATH (due to multi configs).

Just enter the streamers name, name for the video, and end time and fire and forget. Job done.
